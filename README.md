To be assured that DJR is a professional firm which provides excellent outcomes for its clients

<h3>User Experience</h3>

The website is designed for ease of use on any screen size, with clearly separated and unluttered content.
This has been achieved by avoiding long chunks of text and by keeping the pages short: auxillary content can be accessed via modals ad different carousel slides.

The main goals of the user experience are firstly, to attract them to become clients of DJR, and secondly, to allow existing clients to regsiter for and sign in to DJR's cloud-based client portal.

The first goal is achieved via prominent branding and information about the company and its services as the first content of every page. The second goal is achieved by a prominent "Sign in" button call to action visible on every page load, on every device.

<ul>
<li>Navigation bar to allow users to navigate the site quickly and easily, with contrasting text to show them which page they are currently looking at.</li>
<li>A footer (fixed to bottom on larger devices) with the firm's address, some statutory information, and links to the firm's social media pages.</li>

this effect contrasted with the transparency of the title "panes", providing a window to the beautiful background image.</li>

    firm and its unique offerings.</li>
    <li>A section about the firm's trainees and more junior staff, providing updates on their qualification progress and the support the firm offers, partly to
    further familiarise users with all aspects of the firm and partly to encourage prospective trainees to join the firm.
</ul>

<h3>Design</h3>

<p>The general aesthetic is designed to be a mix of the modern and traditional, to reflect the nature of a dynamic professional practice
which has deep roots in a legacy industry like agriculture.</p>

<p>As such, there are minimalist and modern elements, such as the simple logo, and the extended use of angular containers, contrasted
with background images of attractive local environments. These are in turn filtered through opaque coloured squares arranged in a four-pane window pattern as a deliberate homage to the famous Microsoft logo, to subtly impress on the user that this is a technologically fluent practice.</p>

<h4>Colour Scheme</h4>

<p>There is a deliberate contrast of austere black backgrounds and white text (and occasionally vice versa) with colourful backgrounds,
to continue the "old and new" motif.</p>

<p>The new is represented by the minimalism of the black and white, and the old by the colourful backgrounds. The latter choice was also 
motivated by a desire to provide a source of colour, and to evoke a traditional tartan design: a visual language practically synonymous with
countryside life.</p>

<h4>Typography</h4>

<p>For the heading, I used Lato from Google Fonts, and for most of the other text I used Quattrocento, also from Google Fonts</p>

<p>I chose Quattrocento because it seemed modern without being too rounded, to convery a relatively serious tone. I chose Lato in order to give a contrast from the main
body of the page, and also because it is rather less plain than Quattrocento, and stylish enough to draw the eye to the business name.</p>

<h4>Imagery</h4>

<p>The images on the website are of two kinds: four different background images showing scenes of Lancaster and the surrounding countryside, and black and white
photgraphs of the key team members.</p>

<p>The background images are deliberately beautiful, in order to establish in users' minds that this is a local firm, with a rural slant, and the pictures of the staff are black and white 
in order to contrast with the colourful background.</p>

<p>All images are fully licensed.</p>

<h3>Wireframes</h3>

<h3>Features</h3>

<p>The website has twelve features across four pages.</p>

<h4>Current Features</h4>

<h5>Feature 1: Home Page</h5>

<p>The home page has two sections:

<ol>
    <li>A carousel with various testimonies from DJR's current clients praising the firm</li>
    <li>A news section with three stories from related to the accountancy industry</li>
</ol>

The page is fully responsive on mobile and tablet screen sizes.</p>
<p>
The news stories were taken from similar websites and then tailored to the needs of the website - in terms of length, and content.
The testimonials were written by me.
</p>
<p>This page, like all the pages, was constructed using Bootstrap grids, to aid responsiveness to various screen sizes.</p>

<h5>Section 1: the carousel</h5>

<p>This component was taken from the Bootstrap CDN, and then tailored for size, background colour, position on the page, and prominence of the left and right indicators.</p>

<p>I chose the black, slightly opaque background, and the hard rectangle container, for consistency with the overall design philosophy mentioned above.</p>

<h5>Section 2: Latest Industry News</h5>
<p>This section consists of three relevant news stories, with informative headlines and images, accessed by collapsible modals, which display full screen on mobiles and tablets with a light
background and dark text. I chose this because the dark theme seemed too oppresive when fully covering a smaller screen.</p>

<h5>User stories covered by this feature:
<p>User story 3: as a potential stakeholder, I want to find out what the firm does and what it can offer me.</p>
<p>User story 7: as a potential stakeholder, I want to know about the firm's competencies and how its existing clients view its services.</p>
<p>User story 9: as a current stakeholder, I want to be able to qucikly and easily log in to the client portal.</p>
<p>User story 11, as a current stakeholder, I want to see what the latest industry news is.</p>

<h5>Feature 2: Contact Us page</h5>

<p>The home page has three sections:

<ol>
    <li>A call to action to users to sign up to the firm's weekly newsletter, with an embedded form to input the necessary details.</li>
    <li>A call to action to users to sign up tot he firm's cloud-based client portal. This has a much longer and more sophisticated embedded form.</li>
    <li>A section detailing all relevant contact information, including directions, and an embedded Google Map.</li>
</ol>

The page is fully responsive on mobile and tablet screen sizes.</p>
<p>
The copy for the two calls to action was written by me.
</p>

<p>The social media and other icons were taken from the FontAwesome library.</p>
<p>This page, like all the pages, was constructed using Bootstrap grids, to aid responsiveness to various screen sizes.</p>

<h5>Section 1: the newsletter call to action</h5>

<p>This component was taken from the Bootstrap CDN, and then tailored for size, background colour, position on the page, and prominence of the left and right indicators.</p>

<p>I chose the black, slightly opaque background, and the hard rectangle container, for consistency with the overall design philosophy mentioned above.</p>

<h5>Section 2: Latest Industry News</h5>
<p>This section consists of three relevant news stories, with informative headlines and images, accessed by collapsible modals, which display full screen on mobiles and tablets with a light
background and dark text. I chose this because the dark theme seemed too oppresive when fully covering a smaller screen.</p>
