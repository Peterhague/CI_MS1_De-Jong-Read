<h3>User Experience</h3>

The website is designed for ease of use on any screen size, with clearly separated and unluttered content.
This has been achieved by avoiding long chunks of text and by keeping the pages short: auxillary content can be accessed via modals ad different carousel slides.

The main goals of the user experience are firstly, to attract them to become clients of DJR, and secondly, to allow existing clients to regsiter for and sign in to DJR's cloud-based client portal.

The first goal is achieved via prominent branding and information about the company and its services as the first content of every page. The second goal is achieved by a prominent "Sign in" button call to action visible on every page load, on every device.

<h3>Scope</h3>
<p>The project's scope in its initial release is limited to the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigation bar to allow users to navigate the site quickly and easily, with contrasting text to show them which page they are currently looking at.</li>
<li>A footer (fixed to bottom on larger devices) with the firm's address, some statutory information, and links to the firm's social media pages.</li>
<li>Modal allowing users to sign in to the client portal, accessed via a "Sign In" button.</li>
<li>Carousel on the home page with three slides each giving three different testimonies from satisfied current clients.</li>
<li>Latest Industry News section with headlines, summaries, and full stories expandable via "Read more" buttons and full page modals.</li>
<li>A prominently displayed form calling users to sign up for the firm's free weekly newsletter</li>
<li>A large but easily readable form calling users to sign up for the firm's secure online portal.</li>
<li>A section with all relevant information on how to find the firm, including an embedded Google map, directions to the office, and contact details.</li>
<li>A section with biographies of the key individuals of the firm, along with prominent and attractve photographs, displayed in "dynamic", angular, slanted containers, to give the impression of a modern and progressive firm.</li>
<li>A section describing the different services the firm provides, in four broad categories. These are presented as simple rectangles for a modern, minimalist aesthetic, but with
this effect contrasted with the transparency of the title "panes", providing a window to the beautiful background image. This is designed to convey the firm's perceptiveness and insight, but also to reinforce its local foundations via the choice of picturesque local imagery.</li>
<li>A table advertising the firm's membership scheme, with a list of benefits cross-referenced to three different membership levels.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>A section on the homepage with case studies of work done for clients, detailing how specific problems were solved.</li>
    <li>A button in the navigation bar allowing users to book appointments with different team members, via a live calendar.</li>
    <li>A dynamic landing page which would load once on the first visit to the website in any one session, with animated elements giving a welcome and a brief summary of the 
    firm and its unique offerings.</li>
    <li>A section about the firm's trainees and more junior staff, providing updates on their qualification progress and the support the firm offers, partly to
    further familiarise users with all aspects of the firm and partly to encourage prospective trainees to join the firm.
</ul>

<h3>Design</h3>

<p>The general aesthetic is designed to be a mix of the modern and traditional, to reflect the nature of a dynamic professional practice
which has deep roots in a legacy industry like agriculture.</p>

<p>As such, there are minimalist and modern elements, such as the simple logo, and the extended use of angular containers, contrasted
with background images of attractive local environments. These are in turn filtered through opaque coloured squares arranged in a four-pane window pattern as a deliberate homage to the famous Microsoft logo, to subtly impress on the user that this is a technologically fluent practice.</p>

<h4>Colour Scheme</h4>

<p>There is a deliberate contrast of austere black backgrounds and white text (and occasionally vice versa) with colourful backgrounds,
to continue the "old and new" motif.</p>

<p>The new is represented by the minimalism of the black and white, and the old by the colourful backgrounds. The latter choice was also 
motivated by a desire to provide a source of colour, and to evoke a traditional tartan design: a visual language practically synonymous with
countryside life.</p>

<h4>Typography</h4>

<p>For the heading, I used Lato from Google Fonts, and for most of the other text I used Quattrocento, also from Google Fonts</p>

<p>I chose Quattrocento because it seemed modern without being too rounded, to convery a relatively serious tone. I chose Lato in order to give a contrast from the main
body of the page, and also because it is rather less plain than Quattrocento, and stylish enough to draw the eye to the business name.</p>

<h4>Imagery</h4>

<p>The images on the website are of two kinds: four different background images showing scenes of Lancaster and the surrounding countryside, and black and white
photgraphs of the key team members.</p>

<p>The background images are deliberately beautiful, in order to establish in users' minds that this is a local firm, with a rural slant, and the pictures of the staff are black and white 
in order to contrast with the colourful background.</p>

<p>All images are fully licensed.</p>
