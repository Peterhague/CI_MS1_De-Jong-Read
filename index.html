            <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that there was no deliberate inaccuracy in an income tax return despite the taxpayer "fudging" the return as result of a technical issue with the software used to prepare it. However, it also confirmed that HMRC can make discovery assessments after initially deciding not to raise an enquiry.
              On 14 May, the Supreme Court passed its judgement on HMRC v Tooth [2021] UKSC 17, finding for the respondent, Mr Tooth.
              Mr Tooth entered into a tax avoidance scheme and attempted to claim an employment income loss as a result for the 2007/08 tax year.
              Following retrospective legislation that confirmed the scheme Mr Tooth entered into was ineffective, HMRC raised a discovery assessment into his return.
              </p>
              <p>
              To make this assessment, HMRC had to demonstrate that an insufficiency of tax had been brought about carelessly or deliberately. HMRC claimed that there was a deliberate inaccuracy in the return which was the basis on which it was able to raise the assessment.
              The Supreme Court held that there was no such inaccuracy in Mr Tooth’s return. This is not an entirely surprising result given that Mr Tooth had, in the Court’s words, “done his best” with an intractable online form.
              The impact of this is that taxpayers can feel reassured that they should not be penalised for making returns to the best of their abilities provided it is clear what they are claiming and why.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Supreme Court nonetheless found that there had been a valid discovery, albeit of something that wasn’t a deliberate inaccuracy and was therefore made outside of the appropriate time limit.
              The discovery assessment raised after the retrospective legislation had been introduced was therefore valid in the eyes of the Supreme Court.
              This means taxpayers cannot assume that valid assessments will not be subsequently raised on their returns after they have been reviewed and no enquiries have been raised within the standard enquiry window.

              today published research by Royal Holloway which finds that many FTSE 350 annual reports downplay the importance of workforce engagement.</p>
              <p>Changes in workforce engagement have been more an evolution than a revolution, with many companies amending existing practices that have been 
                in place for several years. The case studies included in today’s report set out innovative approaches and fresh thinking that could potentially 
                be applied more widely. Good practice identifie
                research shows how the exact mechanism of engagement is less important than companies’ desire to genuinely engage with employee views 
                and recognise the benefits that such engagement can bring.</p>
                <p>Chris Rees, Professor of Employment Relations, Royal Holloway, University of London and Patrick Brione, Head of Policy and Research, IPA, said:</p>
                <p>“Our review has highlighted some interesting areas of innovation and good practice in how to bring an effective workforce voice into the 
                  boardroom. At the same time, we found that there remains much room for improvement for many firms, in both their practice and reporting. 
                  We hope to see continued progress in this area, as part of a broader move towards building more purpose-driven companies 
                  that reflect the interests of all their stakeholders.”

            <p>Farmers are warning of “damage” to UK agriculture if Australian beef and lamb producers are granted tariff-free access to the UK 
              as part of the first major post-Brexit trade deal.The National Farmers’ Union (NFU) assembled agricultural leaders from all four devolved nations on Tuesday afternoon to voice 
              their concerns amid reports of a split in the cabinet over whether to approve a wide-ranging free trade deal with Australia.
              <p>
              The trade secretary, Liz Truss, is racing to conclude negotiations ahead of the G7 summit, which the UK is hosting in Cornwall 
              in June. The Australian deal is considered crucial, as it would mark the first free trade agreement negotiated since Brexit that was not a 
              rollover of existing agreements with EU trade partners.
              </p>
              <p>
              UK farmers fear soaring imports of cheaply produced Australian beef, lamb and sugar, which they say would drive down the price of food 
              produced to a higher standard, and at a higher cost, in Britain. They are warning of implications for animal welfare and environmental 
              standards. Sheep and beef farmers in more remote parts of Scotland and Wales are considered most at risk.
            </p>
              “I cannot the state the damage that I feel it would do,” said Minette Batters, president of the NFU.. 
              “If we give away our negotiating capital to Australia, which is the second-largest exporter of beef in the world, second to Brazil, the others would most definitely want it.”
              
              The UK exported food and drink products worth £425m to Australia in 2020, while importing £384m worth of Australian food and drink, a
              ccording to analysis of HMRC figures by the Food and Drink Federation (FDF). Wine accounted for the lion’s share of imports from Australia, worth £280m, 
              with lamb and mutton imports worth £46m in second place.
