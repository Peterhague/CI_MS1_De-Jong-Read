          <h3>Phil De Jong ACA</h3>
          <h4>Partner</h4>
          <p>I have been with De Jong-Read for nearly 35 years, after joining from university.
            The firm was established by my father and he mentored me in the profession, and together
            we nurtured our client relationships and grew the practice until his retirement.
          </p>
          <p>I direct the agribusiness side of the practice, and have been lucky enough to establish
            very strong links with our local community, as well as with many agricultural clients acorss the North West.
            I'm passionate about supporting the rural economy and community, and enjoy developing innovative and sustainable
            agribusiness strategies.
          </p>
          <p>I have a little more free time now my children are grown up: I'm a keen gardener and DIY enthusiast, and also enjoy the occasional sailing escapade along the local
            coast - sometimes as far afield as Scotland. Anything to avoid doing the dishes!

          <h3>Liz Read FCA</h3>
          <h4>Partner</h4>
          <p>I joined the firm around 20 years ago as Corporate Services Manager, having 
            qualified as a Charered Accountant with a Big Four firm in 1996. I became Partner
            in 2005 when Phil's father stepped down.
          </p>
          <p>My main area of responsibilty is directing the Audit and Assurance department, although
            I also have oversight of most other areas of the business.
            I have over 25 years' experience in audit and have helped grow the De Jong-Read business by
            more than 200%, turning it into a significant local audit and assurance brand. I'm dedicated to keeping
            our assurance services sleek and modern, with a focus on delivering real strategic value to clients.
          </p>
          <p>Outside of work I'm something of a cricket fanatic, as my husband and I attend test and county matches as often as possible. 
            I'm also a mum to two teenage daughters, neither of whom have any interest in cricket!

          <h3>Natalie Jenkins ACA</h3>
          <h4>Audit & Assurance Manager</h4>
          <p>I joined De Jong-Read straight from school in 2008, after finishing my A levels.
            I qualifed as an Accounting Technician in 2010 and then embarked on the ACA, becoming
            a Chartered Accountant in 2012.
          </p>
          <p>I have worked across the departments at the practice over the years, but specialsied in audit
            following my qualification. I love liaising with and helping our clients, and designing
            efficient control environments for our external audit work. I manage a small team of graduate trainees and
            recently qualified auditors, and greatly enjoy the mentoring side of the work.
          </p>
          <p>I've recently bought my first house with my boyfriend and am learning lots about 
            gardening and decorating, and a bit of DIY. We like to cook a lot and eat out as much as possible.

          <h3>Richard Travers FCCA CTA</h3>
          <h4>Head of Tax</h4>
          <p>I manage the tax department at the firm and so am constantly in demand from all departments! Whether
            liasing with Phil on a new agribusiness product, highlighting key audit issues
          for Liz and Natalie, or managing the flow of compliance requirements of our personal tax clients, I'm kept very busy.</p>
          <p>I originally trained as an auditor for a large London practice, but transitioned to tax in my late
            20s. I've been with the firm for 12 years and relish the sheer variety and and dynamism of the role.
          </p>
          <p>I'm married with four children still at school, so I don't tend to have my time for hobbies.
            When possible I like to play golf at one of the many fine courses in the area, although not to a very
            high standard. I also volunteer for various charities connected to our village community.

          <h3>George Roberts MAAT</h3>
          <h4>Client Relationship Mananger</h4>        
          <p>I joined the practice in 2016 after starting in the profession a few years earlier.
            I qualifed as an Accounting Technician shortly afterwards. I manage the firm's Corporate Services function
            responsible for nurturing client relationships and overseeing the delivery of servcies such as staturory and 
            management accounts production, bookkeeping, and software integration.
          </p>
          <p>I really enjoy the daily client contact the role affords me, as well mentoring and nurturing my young team.
            I always make myself available for my clients and welcome the unpredictable but interesting challenges they present.
          </p>
          <p>In my free time I'm a keen swimmer and hockey player, and enjoy going on walking tours with my partner and our local Church group.</p>
